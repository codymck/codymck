# About Me

ðŸš€ My name is Cody McKinney and my interests are mostly in philosophy, astronomy, aviation, MMA, and of course coding.

ðŸŽ“ I graduated 2023 with a Bachelors in Software Engineering from California State University, San Marcos.

ðŸ“š I am currently learning Rust. I have always loved C++ and thought Rust would be a perfect language to branch off into.

âš¡ I have worked on a variety of projects, including desktop applications, websites, databases, and cloud services, but I am primarily focused on learning more about embedded systems.
