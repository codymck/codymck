# About Me

🚀 My name is Cody McKinney and my interests are mostly philosophy, astronomy, aviation, MMA, and of course coding.

🎓 I graduated in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from California State University, San Marcos.

⚡ I have worked on a variety of projects, including desktop applications, websites, databases, and cloud services, but I am currently working on a 3D Engine with real time updates and physics in my free time from work.
